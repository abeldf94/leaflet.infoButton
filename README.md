# Leaflet.infoButton
Leaflet.infoButton is a [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet) plugin that provides a highly css-customizable popup box on the map.

The code is a modified version of the [Leaflet.infoButton](https://github.com/Eclipse1979/Leaflet.infoButton) made by [Eclipse1979](https://github.com/Eclipse1979)

## Usage: 
You can install this plugin via npm:
```
npm i leaflet.infobutton
```
After install, you can import and use:
```
import 'leaflet.infoButton/dist/leaflet.infoButton';
...
L.control.infoButton({
  buttonTittle: "I'm a button, press me!",
  title: "<h1>This text is customizable</h1>",
  position: "bottomleft",
  html: "This text is customizable too. <p>I'm a paragraph inside HTML &lt;p&gt; tag</p>"
}).addTo(map);
```

## Options:
- `title:` title of the popup box, default is `About`
- `buttonTittle:` title of the popup box, default is `<h1>Title</h1>`
- `html:` html content of the popup, default is `<p>This map was generated by Leaflet.</p>`
- `show:` wether the popup should activate at the beginning, default is `false`
- `minWidth:` allows you to hide the map interface on mobile devices by setting a minimum screen size, default is `500`
- It also support the same options as those of [Control](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#control) such as position.
